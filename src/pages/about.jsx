                Hey there ðŸ‘‹
              </p>
              <p>
              Hello,I&apos;m Fareha Hassan, a passionate software engineer with a lifelong dream of diving deeper into the fascinating realms of artificial intelligence and robotics. My journey into software engineering began with a love for mathematics, and as I delved further into this field, my interest in it only grew stronger. Currently, I am a web and app developer, earning a livelihood through my skills.
              </p>
              <p>
              My childhood aspiration was to become a software engineer, and I&apos;m proud to have turned that dream into a reality. However, I believe that learning is a lifelong process, and I&apos;m eager to expand my horizons by venturing into the exciting domains of artificial intelligence and robotics. These fields hold boundless potential for innovation and problem-solving, and I&apos;m committed to exploring their depths to further my knowledge and skills.
              </p>
              <p>
              Throughout my career as a web and app developer, I&apos;ve honed my problem-solving skills and developed a keen eye for detail. These attributes have been instrumental in my software engineering journey, and I look forward to applying them to the challenges and opportunities that AI and robotics present. My experiences have also reinforced the importance of collaboration and adaptability in the fast-paced world of technology, and I&apos;m excited to carry these values into my exploration of AI and robotics. Together, let&apos;s embrace the endless possibilities of these fields and work towards a future where technology empowers and enriches our lives in ways we&apos;ve only begun to imagine.
              </p>
              <p>
              In closing, I am excited to continue my evolution as a software engineer, and I am determined to bring the magic of AI and Robotics to life. The future holds infinite opportunities to push the envelope and drive innovation, and I am committed to being at the forefront of this technological revolution. As I embark on this exciting journey, I&apos;m reminded of a quote that has been my guiding principle:
              </p>
              <p>
                Overall, I am grateful for the path I have chosen in the tech industry and am excited to see where it takes me in the future.
